Multiprocessing, on the other hand, uses multiple processes for parallel execution and is ideal for CPU-bound tasks. The choice between multithreading and multiprocessing depends on the nature of the task and the hardware available. Python provides libraries like `threading` for multithreading and `multiprocessing` for multiprocessing to facilitate concurrent and parallel programming."
